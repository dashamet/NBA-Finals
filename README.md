# 2019 NBA Finals

* `championsdata.csv` and `runnerupsdata.csv` contain data on all NBA finals games from 1980 - 2018 for champion and runner up teams respectively. Variables in the datasets include year, team name, game number, win or loss, home or away game, and team performance statistics. The data was scraped from [basketball-reference.com](https://www.basketball-reference.com) by Dave Rosenman and uploaded on Kaggle: you can find it [here](https://www.kaggle.com/daverosenman/nba-finals-team-stats/version/6).

* `2019_nba_finals.xlsx` contains data on the 2019 NBA finals that I sourced from [basketball-reference.com](https://www.basketball-reference.com/playoffs/2019-nba-finals-warriors-vs-raptors.html) 

* `2019-nba-finals.Rmd` contains my code for the visualizations. It produces the HTML file `2019-nba-finals.html`.
